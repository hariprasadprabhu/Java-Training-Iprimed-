why amgular framework?
=> 2010 angular js
	suppported web, mobile application
	html css js --- also we use jsp servlets spring and any database at backend

=> once load and store as a cachte so faster
=> 2016	angular ts
	much most faster than previous version
	compile time we can get error because of ts
=> 2017 angular ts 4.0 	
	
=> front end dinamically changing with user interaction
